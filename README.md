I am a Data Engineer at BTPN Syariah, focusing on developing data infrastructure and pipelines that support business processes and data-driven analysis. I have experience in building scalable data solutions using Amazon Web Services (AWS) technologies such as S3, Glue, Step Functions (SFN), Lambda (LFN), as well as SSIS, SQL Server, Python, and visualization tools like Tableau.

In the world of data, I enjoy not only operational tasks and ETL/ELT pipeline development but also the application of Machine Learning to deliver added business value through predictions and data-based automation. I believe that data is not just numbers, but a story that can inspire strategic decisions.

Currently, I continue to develop my skills in data engineering and machine learning to be able to create innovative, effective, and efficient large-scale data solutions.
